# Demo: ERC20 Token — ShaniAI Export (Vite)

- Chain: sepolia
- Address: 0x88d021C5979a461e607d14Ff9eECAB530781D99D
- ABI hash: 825c7b3f

This is a minimal React + Vite dApp scaffold generated by ShaniAI. It exposes your contract ABI with simple read and write forms using viem.

## Project layout

- \`src/functions.ts\` — viem helpers + your ABI and address
- \`src/App.tsx\` — simple Interact-like UI that renders forms dynamically

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- A Sepolia RPC endpoint (Alchemy or Infura recommended)
- A wallet extension such as MetaMask with Sepolia test ETH for write calls

## 1) Create an RPC key (Alchemy or Infura)

Alchemy (recommended):
- Create an app for Ethereum Sepolia and copy the HTTPS URL.
- In the app settings, add these Allowed Domains (CORS):
  - http://localhost:5173
  - http://127.0.0.1:5173
  Updates may take a few minutes to propagate.

Infura (alternative):
- Create a project, enable Ethereum API, select Sepolia, and copy the endpoint.

## 2) Configure environment

Copy the template and set ONE of the options below.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Option A — provide the full RPC URL (takes precedence):

```ini
VITE_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
```

Option B — provide only a key and let the app compose the URL:

```ini
VITE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
# or
VITE_INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

Notes:
- After editing .env, restart the dev server so Vite picks up new variables.
- Public endpoints (e.g., https://rpc.sepolia.org) are supported but can be slow or rate limited.

## 3) Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# App will start at http://localhost:5173
```

## 4) Using the dApp

- Read calls work without a wallet.
- Write calls open your wallet to sign and must be on the Sepolia network.
- If your contract address is not set, add it in \`src/functions.ts\` or regenerate from ShaniAI with the address.

## Troubleshooting

- "Unexpected token 'O'... not valid JSON": Usually CORS. Ensure your Alchemy key allows http://localhost:5173 and wait for propagation; then restart Vite.
- Env changes not picked up: Stop and start \`npm run dev\`.
- Slow/timeout reads: Prefer a keyed provider (Alchemy/Infura) instead of public RPCs.
- No wallet found: Install MetaMask (or another EIP-1193 wallet) and switch to Sepolia.

## Security & scope

- Transactions are signed client-side; no private keys are stored.
- This scaffold is testnet-first (Sepolia). Mainnet is out of scope for the MVP.
